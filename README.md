This repository is a collection of python scripts that perform image manipulations
using numpy arrays. These scripts are the results of a learning exercise for my 
engineering senior design project at Purdue University Northwest. Some of the scripts
are written using Jupyter Notebook, but they all have respective .py files that run
from terminal.
